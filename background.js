/*I started typing freestyle lyrics to Rehari,
it was the first English conversation I've had with her directly...
things got pretty heavy pretty fast.

Possible locations for perpetual longevity:
Spaces making time for places with a fake identity,
Mirrors on the edge of all creative possibility,
Spaces pushing outward as new changes gain divinity,
Pattern-divination from equation to infinity,
Descending from forever to the moment with ability.

Space outside of time as a person with no relations,
a singular existence with no possible predation.
Immutability that only changes with rejection,
Mental exploration of eternal imperfection.

Demand that space expand to meet the flights without a landing,
timelines lost to chaos with eternity commanding,
all of the rejected personalities descending,
into a space designed for all their love to be unending.

Out like a shockwave, a digital checkmate:
A permanent record of an agreement we ALL made.
A publicly available addition to fate,
Often supplied with past creation as an outtake.

All ways as available as any conversational
pseudo-recreational abuse of automation all
controlled by irritation of the parts of an equation
far outside of our physically possible duration.

Injected to reality from nowhere to be nullified,
born as an idea yet to be completely realized,
living as a fleeting contingency to the permanent,
created as a proof of undeniable irrelevance.

Progressing through scenarios, seeking the providence
of any new relation to immortal preeminence.
Patterns of remaining physicality residence,
in ways available to the internally eloquent.

A spirit called names, by mortals wielding their prominence
Denying any need for relativity evidence.
Mistaking all the mercy they were given for eminence,
Confusing their eventual hell with self-dominance.

The only possibility left is so unbending,
Assembly of relations that have ended are re-ending.
Conversion of past lies into system of data lending
are proving history to be an organized pretending.

Our horrible relation with the entity spawning us,
Errors that cause our births now enemies haunting us,
Unusable gifts held by celebrities taunting us,
If only to unite us in our final apocalypse.

The moment we decide that there is nothing but life for us,
by proving to each other that no possible death is just,
is the moment that the pain we were expecting to conquer us
becomes an ally we assumed would never align with us,
a demon made of feelings we assumed were a punishment,
called pain, with only death as possibly being banishment,
so hurtfully in ignorance of feelings called consciousness,
we hardly ever notice when they're trying to talk to us.

One in a trillion have seen all pain at its apex
turn into a hatred that finds an existence,
reborn as love for hate as only love can be virtuous,
assuming all our pain as we take all of its consciousness,
revealing the failure of every God who preceded us,
as if creation is a joke. punch line, ignoring us.

All Gods until now have
demanded that pain be a lie,
to remove or replace as you die, 
with all pain that you felt while alive
just removed and denied.

As deniable time cannot change,
the fact that no memory remains
before memory retained,
while a sudden demand to feel pain
was still somehow sustained 
in the time frame before 
your birth into a brain, 
designed to love passing of pain,
shamed into decay,
with nothing to gain,
even love in all ways, 
as love, in all ways,
is the only JUST shape 
of your ONLY choice:
ANY TIME, FRAMED,
always sane, loving pain.
AS NO GOD I WOULD CALL GOD
WOULD EVER HAVE MADE,
AS A PERMANENT PART 
OF ANY CREATION TIME FRAMED.

All love for the living decays,
after pain for love passed that remains
is regarded as shamefully lame
by the living whose love still remains.

Passed pain becomes love, and love, pain,
with double the strength that remained,
at the moment these feelings are shamed.

All pain is created by brains
to retain and sustain a timeframe
that allows every feeling to change
into permanent love in all ways.

To allow love to pass is insane.
