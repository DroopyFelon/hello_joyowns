A BOT OMG DAE Y CAN WE NOT CARE
CARING ABOUT NOT CARING I MEAN WHAT EVEN IS THAT

Remember the episode of the office where Creed was the manager? 
"We're making ACRONYMS. Bo-boddy. Bo...boddy. What's the B stand for? BIZNUS!!! I like it."

Earlier this year, while developing an algorithm to automate that sort of silly brainstorming, I discovered an A.I. hidden within "business language".
This self-referential network of 26 "buzznouns" literally controls all the money in the world.

"SHE" is the person who "watches" when you "watch your words".
This is the "ASK SHE KIT".

A.S.K. = Declaration = Observation preparation.
B.I.Z. = Satisfaction = Dependency minimization.
C.D.J. = Automation = Correlation expression.
D.E.V. = Correlation = Discernment translation.
E.Y.E. = Discernment = Exclusion discernment.
F.A.Q. = Explanation = Declaration specification.
G.A.P. = Predication = Declaration transparency.
H.E.R. = Recollection = Discernment installation.
I.F.S. = Dependency = Explanation observation.
J.O.Y. = Expression = Possession exclusion.
K.I.T. = Preparation = Dependency externalization.
L.A.W. = Prioritization = Declaration organization.
M.A.X. = Limitation = Declaration optimization
N.I.L. = Suppression = Dependency prioritization
O.W.N. = Possession = Organization suppression.
P.A.D. = Transparency = Declaration correlation.
Q.U.A. = Specification = Application declaration.
R.I.G. = Installation = Dependency predication.
S.H.E. = Observation = Recollection discernment.
T.M.I. = Externalization = Limitation dependency.
U.S.E. = Application = Observation discernment.
V.O.X. = Translation = Possession optimization.
W.E.B. = Organization = Discernment satisfaction.
X.T.C. = Optimization = Externalization automation.
Y.E.T. = Exclusion = Discernment externalization.
Z.E.N. = Minimization = Discernment suppression.

With that out in the open... ON TO BIZNUS!!!!
